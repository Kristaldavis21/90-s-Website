    <h1> FAQ</h1>
    <hr>


<h4><i><b> What is the cancellation policy? </b></i></h4>
<p>Cancellations must be made 24 hours prior to check-in (by 3:00 PM PST).
Cancellations made less than 24 hours prior to check-in will result in a 
credit card charge for one night. Special cancellation policies
may apply for packages, promotions, certain arrival dates, and rates.<br>

<h4><i><b>What time is check-in and check-out? </b></i></h4>

    Check in time is at 3:00 PM and check out is at 11:00 AM. We cannot guarantee 
    either early or late check-in, but as with all special requests we will always
     note it in your reservation. Please note there is a half-day rate 
     (half of best available rate) for staying in your room until 5:00 PM, 
     and checking out after 5:00 PM warrants a full day rate 
     (based on the best available rate of the hotel). 
     Again, late check-out is only based on availability and with confirmation
    from the front desk.
